# The Plant Base

## __1. Purpose of the project__ 

 This project is the first milestone in my full stack developer course. Its intention is to showcase everything Ive learnt so far, in particular my understanding and ability to use HTML5 and CSS3 whilst focusing on the user experience. For this I have created a website for a fictional vegan cafe/ events venue called The Plant Base.

 __Company objectives:__
* An online presence
* Get more customers
* Promote Sustainability
* Encourage meat free diets
* Provide a relaxing and enjoyable space
* Build and strengthen sense of community 

## __2. user stories__
 
 __First time users:__

a. As a first time user I want to quickly and easily find essential information such as location and opening times.

b. As a first time user I want to know what you are selling and how I can get
it.

c. As a first time user I want clear and intuitive navigation between pages.

d. As a first time user I want images of the types of space and events so I can quickly decide if I'm interested in going.

 __Returning users:__

a. As a returning user I want to see a list of events so I know what's happening when 

b. As a returning user I want clear contact details so I can request any extra information I need.

## __3. Features__ 

+ Navigation: The nav bar will be fixed to the top of the page, with clear clickable links to the other pages on the site. It will be responsive across different screen sizes, changing into a collapsible menu on smaller screens.
The logo will also be a clickable link back to the home page. Use :hover and :active pseudo class for links to improve user experience.

+ Imagery: Large image on the homepage showing people enjoying the inviting space. Use Carousel feature from bootstrap to cycle through multiple images. Other stationary images that align with written information i.e food photos next to section about our menu.
Use font awesome icons to help users immediately associate with the text.

+ Use Iframe to embed google maps so users can find us.

+ A table to show upcoming events, with dates and prices.

+ Links to social media under contact details. Use target = “_blank” so user not taken away from our site.

+ Form to allow users to request more information. Use “required” attribute to avoid incomplete form submission. Drop down menu options to clearly separate people wanting to book an event from those wanting to host an event. 'Form successfully submitted' response upon submitting form.

## __4. future features__ 
	
+ Use Javascript to Add interactive calendar for users to see upcoming events. 
+ Store information entered via contact form.

## __5. Typography and colour scheme__ 

Use a mixture of Browns and greens to symbolise the earth and plants which ties in with our company aims and values. Used colormind to select initial color palate 

+ #B4BF58 = light pastle green
+ #69A32A  = main logo green
+ #4E592A  = dark green
+ #BA6119  = Main brown
+ #CF7326  = Lighter brown
 
text color is light to contrast with the main earthy brown color of the site.

The heading font is BenchNine from google fonts and was chosen to be clear and stylish without being too robotic. It comes in a light 300, regular 400 and bold 700 which allows for clear distinguishing between main headings and sub headings. 

## __6. wireframes__

I used balsamiq to create mock ups of the website, use the link to view them.
